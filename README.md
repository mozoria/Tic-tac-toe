Technologies used JS, Boostrap, JQuery, sass, html.

problem solving strategy was talking it through and determining how the problem could solved in english and just words first before trying to turn it into code.
For problems that I could not solve I would first go to google and research different ways to solve the issue and then determine which way I found most understanding for me. Tackled one problem at a time and just tried taking it step by step after realizing that trying to everything at once became very chaotic and it was hard to follow what was going on. If googled didn't provide any insight I would ask others around me on their own thought process and how they solved issues.
If that still didnt help then I went to the issue queue, which I shouldve used more often a lot of times.

Unsolved problems, would be i am not to happy with the set up of the project and where the buttons are placed and just how organized it is as a whole. I need to solve the games played to reset/refresh when clicked because the button leaves after it shows the game and if i sign out it still displays. Making the actual board look more like a typical tic tac toe board and not so rectangular.
